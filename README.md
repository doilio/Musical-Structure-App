## Project 4: Musical Structure Application
## Project Overview
 > This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned so far in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using Intents, New Activities, Arraylists, Loops and Custom Classes.
 The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.
 ## Requirements
The required components for this project are:
* 2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents
* A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.
* A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.
